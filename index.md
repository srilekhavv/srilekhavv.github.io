## About Me

I am a first year Masters student at UCSC studying Computer Science and Engineering. I also recieved my B.S. in Computer Science with a minor in Bioinformatics at UCSC in 2022. My research interests include Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Distributed Systems.

## Projects

*   Jan 2022 - Mar 2022: In a group of other students, I worked on a project about predicting stock prices. We created a website, using ReactJS, where a user can input a stock, and it returns the predicted price for the next five days. The prediction is done by an LSTM model using previous data about the stock prices.

*   June 2021 - Sept 2021: I had an internship at Intel and the project that I worked on for that summer was creating an internal tool that made it easier for people to use their CoFluent simulation program. The technologies I had to work with inclued ReactJS, NodeJS, and Docker.

*   June 2019 - Sept 2019: I was an intern at Cloudera for the Program Managment team. I created a tool that allowed the managers to use Google Sheets to run analysis on data from Jira autmatically. I used Google App Script and Jira's Rest API.

## Hobbies and Interests

Outside of coding, I enjoy going to the beach, which is a less than 10 minute walk from where I live. During my down time, I like hanging out with friends and watching Formula One on weekend mornings.
